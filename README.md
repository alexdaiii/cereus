## Description

This project aims to create a modern React component library for visualizing
protein and genomic sequence annotations.
Inspired by [@rcsb/rcsb-saguaro](https://github.com/rcsb/rcsb-saguaro), this
library
is designed to work seamlessly with popular modern React frameworks
such as
Next.js, Remix, Create React App, and Vite.
Leveraging the power of [@visx](https://airbnb.io/visx/) components, it provides
a developer-friendly API that allows for easy extension of the protein and
genomic sequence viewer.
With this library, developers can create rich, interactive visualizations of
protein and genomic data right out of the box.
